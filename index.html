      <p>As a team leader in my college major project, I spearheaded the development of a dynamic website for a health insurance company. The website aimed to streamline the time-consuming processes for the company, hospitals, and customers. It featured a homepage with contact, about, and service pages, followed by a sign-up and registration page. Upon logging in, users could access personalized pages such as patients, admin, and hospital staff. Patients could view their admission history, diagnoses, and claim status. Hospital staff could track claims and approve/disapprove them, while the admin had oversight of claim approvals, billing, and data accuracy, ensuring seamless online operations.</p>

      <p>During my internship at Internworld, I developed a StackOverflow clone project using the MERN stack. I was responsible for requirements gathering, design, front-end and back-end development, API integration, testing, deployment, and maintenance. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in full-stack development, including React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I gained valuable experience in agile methodologies, teamwork, and problem-solving. Overall, this internship enhanced my understanding of full-stack development and ignited my passion for creating user-centric applications.
