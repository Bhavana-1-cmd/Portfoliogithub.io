      <p>As the team leader of my college major project, I played a pivotal role in developing a dynamic website aimed at revolutionizing the operations of a health insurance company. This ambitious project sought to streamline time-consuming processes for the company, hospitals, and customers, bringing efficiency and convenience to all stakeholders.

        The website boasted a well-designed homepage, complete with informative sections such as contact, about, and services pages. To enhance user experience, we incorporated a user-friendly sign-up and registration page, allowing individuals to create personalized accounts.
        
        Once logged in, users gained access to personalized pages tailored to their roles, including patients, admin, and hospital staff. Patients could effortlessly view their admission history, diagnoses, and real-time updates on claim status. Hospital staff, on the other hand, were empowered with the ability to track claims, approve or disapprove them, and effectively manage the overall process. The admin had an overarching role, ensuring accurate claim approvals, billing accuracy, and maintaining data integrity.</p>

      <p>During my internship at Internworld, I developed a StackOverflow clone project using the MERN stack. I was responsible for requirements gathering, design, front-end and back-end development, API integration, testing, deployment, and maintenance. This project allowed me to showcase my skills in full-stack development, including React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I gained valuable experience in agile methodologies, teamwork, and problem-solving. Overall, this internship enhanced my understanding of full-stack development and ignited my passion for creating user-centric applications.
